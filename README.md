## Technologies Used

- **HTML5**: Structure and markup
- **CSS3**: Modern styling with custom layouts
- **JavaScript**: Dynamic grid manipulation and interactivity
- **GitHub Pages**: Deployment and hosting

## Design Philosophy

The project showcases two distinct design approaches while maintaining the same core functionality:

- **No Gradients**: Clean, solid colors throughout
- **Modern Layouts**: Sidebar vs. top toolbar implementations
- **Responsive Design**: Adapts to different screen sizes
- **Unique Identities**: Each page has its own visual personality
